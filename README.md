# Clipboard Manager

A desktop application written in Java 21 for managing clipboard content. The application listens to the clipboard, stores clipboard items in an SQLite database, and allows you to manage and organize clipboard entries based on content type (STRING, FILE, IMAGE).

## Features

- **Clipboard Monitoring:** Continuously monitors and stores clipboard content (STRING, FILE, IMAGE) in an SQLite database.
- **Configurable Storage Limit:** You can configure how many clipboard entries to store in the database. Older entries are automatically deleted when the limit is exceeded.
- **Graphical Interface:** Press **Ctrl + Shift + X** to open a graphical interface to view, delete, or re-add clipboard entries.
- **Content Management:** Supports STRING, FILE, and IMAGE clipboard types.
- **Single/Multiple Item Deletion:** You can delete individual clipboard entries or remove all items at once.

## Requirements

- Java 21 or higher
- SQLite Database
