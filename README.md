üìù A desktop application written in `Java 21` for managing clipboard content. The application listens to the clipboard, stores clipboard items in an SQLite database, and allows you to manage and organize clipboard entries based on content type `STRING`, `FILE`, `IMAGE`.

## üöÄ Features

- **Clipboard Monitoring:** Continuously monitors and stores clipboard content (STRING, FILE, IMAGE) in an SQLite database.
- **Configurable Storage Limit:** You can configure how many clipboard entries to store in the database. Older entries are automatically deleted when the limit is exceeded.
- **Graphical Interface:** Press the configured shortcut (e.g., **Ctrl + Alt + X** or **F5**) to open a graphical interface to view, delete, or re-add clipboard entries. By default, the shortcut is set to **F7**, but it can be customized in the **ui\_shortcut** field of the configuration.
- **Content Management:** Supports **STRING**, **FILE**, and **IMAGE** clipboard types.
- **Single/Multiple Item Deletion:** You can delete individual clipboard entries or remove all items at once.

> üí°**Note**:
> The configuration file and SQLite database will be automatically created on the first run.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can set the number of clipboard entries to store in the config file. The program will delete older clipboard entries once the limit is exceeded. An example config file in JSON format:

```json

  "clipboard_types": [
    "STRING",
    "FILE",
    "IMAGE"
  ],

    "restart": "Ctrl+Alt+F11",
    "close_app": "Ctrl+Alt+O",
    "open_ui": "F7",
    "clear_all_clipboard": "Ctrl+Alt+F8",
    "delete_last_data": "Alt+F8",
    "clear_system_clipboard": "Ctrl+Alt+F9"
  },
  "theme": "MAC_DARK",
  "clipboard_save_count": 50,
  "clipboard_handler_period": {
    "clipboard_handler_mills": 500,
    "clipboard_image_handler_sec": 10
  }
}
```

### üìã Clipboard Types

The clipboard manager supports the following clipboard types:

### üé® Themes

The clipboard manager supports multiple themes for the UI:

```json
{
  "clipboard_save_count": 50,
  "clipboard_handler_period": {

    "clipboard_image_handler_sec": 10
  }
}
```

- `clipboard_save_count`: The maximum number of clipboard entries stored.
